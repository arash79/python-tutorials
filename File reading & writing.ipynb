    "Before we can go into how to work with files in Python, it’s important to understand what exactly a file is and how modern operating systems handle some of their aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, a file is a contiguous set of bytes used to store data. This data is organized in a specific format and can be anything as simple as a text file or as complicated as a program executable. In the end, these byte files are then translated into binary 1 and 0 for easier processing by the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Files on most modern file systems are composed of three main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Header:** metadata about the contents of the file (file name, size, type, and so on)\n",
    "2. **Data:** contents of the file as written by the creator or editor\n",
    "3. **End of file (EOF):** special character that indicates the end of the file"

    "One problem often encountered when working with file data is the representation of a new line or line ending. The line ending has its roots from back in the Morse Code era, when a specific pro-sign was used to communicate the end of a transmission or the end of a line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, this was standardized for teleprinters by both the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the American Standards Association (ASA). ASA standard states that line endings should use the sequence of the Carriage Return (```CR``` or ```\\r```) and the Line Feed (```LF``` or ```\\n```) characters (```CR+LF``` or ```\\r\\n```). The ISO standard however allowed for either the ```CR+LF``` characters or just the LF character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Windows uses the ```CR+LF``` characters to indicate a new line, while Unix and the newer Mac versions use just the ```LF``` character. This can cause some complications when you’re processing files on an operating system that is different than the file’s source. Here’s a quick example:"

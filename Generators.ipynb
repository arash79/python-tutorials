    "\n",
    "On the whole, yield is a fairly simple statement. Its primary job is to control the flow of a generator function in a way that’s similar to ```return``` statements. As briefly mentioned above, though, the Python ```yield``` statement has a few tricks up its sleeve.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call a generator function or use a generator expression, you return a special iterator called a generator. You can assign this generator to a variable in order to use it. When you call special methods on the generator, such as ```next()```, the code within the function is executed up to yield.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the Python ```yield``` statement is hit, the program suspends function execution and returns the yielded value to the caller. <mark>**In contrast, return stops function execution completely.**</mark> When a function is suspended, the state of that function is saved. This includes any variable bindings local to the generator, the instruction pointer, the internal stack, and any exception handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to resume function execution whenever you call one of the generator’s methods. In this way, all function evaluation picks back up right after yield. You can see this in action by using multiple Python yield statements:"

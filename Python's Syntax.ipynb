    "In order to separate blocks of code (like for loops, if blocks and function definitions) the compiler/interpreter needs something to tell it when a block ends. Curly braces and end statements are perfectly valid ways of providing this information for the compiler. For a human to be able to read the code indentation is a much better way of providing the visual cues about block structure.\n",
    "Python does not mandate how you indent (two spaces or four, tabs or spaces - but not both), just that you do it consistently. Those that get used to the Python way of doing things tend to start seeing curly braces as unnecessary line noise that clutters code.\n",

    "Identifiers in Python are case-sensitive, so temperature and Temperature are distinct names. Identifiers can be composed of almost any combination of letters, numerals, and underscore characters (or more general Unicode characters). The primary restrictions are that an identifier cannot begin with a numeral (thus 9lives is an illegal name), and that there are 33 specially reserved words that cannot be used as identifiers, as shown in table below:\n",
